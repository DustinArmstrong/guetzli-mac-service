# guetzli-mac-service
Bash shell script-turned-Mac-service for batch processing using Guetzli

The script and service assume that Guetzli was installed with `brew install guetzli` which by default installs it into the path `/usr/local/Cellar/guetzli/1.0/bin/guetzli`. If you unarchived into another location, substitute that location in the script/service instead.
